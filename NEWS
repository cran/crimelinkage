* Switched to the formula interface for naiveBayes() to be more consistent with other R functions. 
  - There is also a naiveBayes.fit() function to pass in data w/o formula.
  - Note: this is different than the function from previous version. Old calls 
    will no longer work. Please update to the new interface.
* Added S3 methods: plot.naiveBayes, predict.naiveBayes
* Improved compareCrimes() function.  
  - Better estimation of the expected absolute differences between the temporal 
    crime variables using convolution. It is now a deterministic function. 
  - Uncensored event times, if exact times are known, are now permitted.
* Updated crimes dataset with a slight modification to some dates.
* Updated predict.naiveBayes() to give warning when a predictor is not included 
    in model, but continue to give results.
* Corrected typos in vignettes
* Added default packges to imports


# crimelinkage 0.0.3 (04/18/2015)

* Initial package submission
